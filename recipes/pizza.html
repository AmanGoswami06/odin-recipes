            This Cast Iron Skillet Pizza recipe is easy and fun to make. It bakes in the oven in about 15 minutes. I top
            it with pepperoni in this recipe, but you can use your favorite toppings to make restaurant-style pizza in
            your own kitchen!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb pizza dough (room temperature for 2-5 hours)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup mozzarella cheese (shredded)</li>
            <li>0.5 cups cheddar, shredded</li>
            <li>¼ medium red onion, sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup pepperoni slices</li>
            <li>¼ tsp Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tbsp basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Makes</h2>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>While homemade pizza may have a few steps, each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the
            perfect Italian meal! 😋</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a 12” cast iron skillet by placing it on the middle rack in the oven and setting the heat to 500
                degrees F.</li>
            <li>Stretch room temperature pizza dough with flour, in the shape of a circle.</li>
            <li>Remove the hot skillet from the oven (leave oven on). Drizzle half the olive oil on the bottom of the
                skillet, and brush it around to evenly coat the cast iron pan. Add dough on top. Push the edges
                carefully around the cast iron skillet, to form a 1” crust. Brush the crust with olive oil and sprinkle
                with salt.</li>
            <li>Par-bake pizza dough (without toppings) for 3 minutes in the oven on 500 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Bake cast iron pizza for 10-12 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and the crust is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve with fresh basil.</li>
        </ol>

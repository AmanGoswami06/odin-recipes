            This Cast Iron Skillet Pizza recipe is easy and fun to make. It bakes in the oven in about 15 minutes. I top
            it with pepperoni in this recipe, but you can use your favorite toppings to make restaurant-style pizza in
            your own kitchen!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/3 pounds (21 ounces) cold ground beef (80 percent lean)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 sesame burger buns</li>
            <li>4 to 8 slices American cheese, optional</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: mayonnaise, leaf lettuce, sliced tomato, sliced onion, pickles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Makes</h2>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>While homemade Burger may have a few steps, each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the
            perfect Italian meal! 😋</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Heat a gas grill on high for 10 minutes with the lid closed or prepare a hot
                charcoal grill fire.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, divide 1 1/3 pounds (21 ounces) cold ground beef (80 percent lean) into 4 equal portions and
                shape the meat into patties that are wider than your buns (the burgers will shrink a bit during
                grilling). If you have two deli lids, use those to form the patty. Otherwise, form the patties so there
                is a depression in the center with an approximately 1/2-inch wide rim around the edge. Handle the meat
                as little as possible.</li>
            <li>Season the burger patties with 1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper on
                both sides.</li>
            <li>When the grill is ready, place the burgers over direct heat and let sit without flipping or moving until
                nicely charred and the patties release easily from the grill grate, 4 to 5 minutes. The burgers should
                release easily from the grill. If you try to flip them and they’re sticking, wait another minute or so.
            </li>
            <li>SFlip the burger patties and cook, undisturbed, for 4 to 5 minutes more or until cooked to your liking
                (use a thermometer if needed: the internal temperature should be 135 F for medium-rare burgers or 145 F
                for medium).</li>
            <li>In the last minute or so of cooking, place 4 sesame burger buns on the grill to toast and place 1 or 2
                slices of the 4 to 8 slices American cheese, if using, on top of each burger patty to melt.</li>
            <li>Serve the burgers right away on the toasted buns with your choice of optional toppings: mayonnaise, leaf
                lettuce, sliced tomato, sliced onion, and/or pickles.</li>

        </ol>
